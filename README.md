# stock-analysis

Overview of Project:
Steve has gathered some Stock Data on years 2017 and 2018 to be on track and help his parents with the best time and best Stock to buy. He is good at Excel but he can help with the better analysis. We are going to use BVA to help Steve with his Stock Data Analysis.

Results: 
Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

Steve is interested in figuring out the total daily volume and yearly return for each stock. By knowing the daily volume he will know the total number of shares traded throughout the day and by yearly return he will have the measures on how actively a stock is traded. The yearly return is the percentage difference in price from the beginning of the year to the end of the year. He also wants to know more about analysis since his parents are interested in one particular stock named Daqo's stock.

By adding up all of the daily volume for DQ, we'll have the yearly volume and an idea of how often it gets traded.
After calculating the DQ stock in 2018, we saw that Daqo dropped over 63% in 2018! With this finding Steve will definitely not offer this stock to his parents.

We also heled him to be able to calculate all Stocks and bot 2017 and 2018 worksheet. After running the program we can see that in 2018 most of the stocks had negative percentage. So overall the stock market was not good, If we look at the 2017, we can see that stock in 2017 grow better than 2018.

Summary: 
1.	What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
It is a great tool to use and will help a lot with analysis, but the disadvantages would be for big data that will take time and may cause big chaos. 

2.	How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
Using VBA in Excel makes the task run faster than doing it manually. We can avoid doing repetitive commands and benefit from it. We can create buttons and assign a macro to the worksheet where the results display, so the user does not have to deal with the code. This will help the user get results faster and easier. We can reuse the commands, and this will save time in our analysis.
